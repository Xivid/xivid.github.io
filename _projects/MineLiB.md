  Accelerating data mining algorithms on modern computing hardware is critical for efficient use of the data deluge available in the cloud today. In this project we want to develop a library of algorithmic building blocks (sub-operators) optimize them, and expose them as an application programming interface (API) for data mining application developers. This set of library API, allow the integration of different optimized implementations of these sub-operators targeting different platforms (multicore CPUs, FPGAs, GPUs, etc.).
