I am a master's student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inf.ethz.ch">Department of Computer Science</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a> working in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.systems.ethz.ch">Systems Group</a>. 
I am interested in the intersection of computer systems and artificial intelligence. I am extremely excited about building underlying systems for emerging new applications, as well as designing and analyzing systems on algorithmic guarantee. My current research focuses on hardware accelerators (e.g. FPGAs) for data processing and machine learning.

I received my bachlor's degree from the <a target="_blank" href="http://honors.hit.edu.cn">Computer Science Experimental Class</a> (the honour class) of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.hit.edu.cn">Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China</a> in July 2017. 
Playing with all kinds of novel technologies while failing to go deep in any direction, I had been a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/footoo">HIT IBM Technology Center (a.k.a. FoOTOo Lab)</a> since the summer of my freshman year.
Having studied as a semester exchange student in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.hku.hk">Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU)</a> in my junior year, I found my great interests in systems and programming languages.
During the final-year internship in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/">Systems Research Group</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)</a>, I was honoured to participate in exciting research on distributed machine learning systems under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lintaoz/">Dr. Lintao Zhang</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~xjl/">Dr. Jilong Xue</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/huzho/">Dr. Hucheng Zhou</a>, which made me determined to pursue an academic career.
